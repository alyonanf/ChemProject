# ChemProject
The project should help with mastering a foundational skill for organic chemistry -- naming the structures

### Details
- 2D constructor of molecules
- shows the formula for the constructed alkane without radicals
- names the main chain and displays its length
- uses Python (Pygame)

### Instructions
- clicking the left mouse button creates a carbon
- clicking the left mouse button on existing carbon allows to drag it
- clicking on two different carbons with the right mouse button creates a connection between them
- the program determines the longest chain in the created structure and names it accordingly
